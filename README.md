## People Behind The Programs

As the old saying goes, “a project is worth a thousand jobs.” Or, something like that.

Early-stage software developers can feel at a disadvantage on LinkedIn and traditional resumes. Why? The lack of relevant employment history makes them look like they don’t have any experience. But, experience doesn’t require a boss and a paycheck. It just needs time and effort.

The purpose of this site is to highlight the skills gained with projects and actual experience. It will let programmers give their professional bio, list all their skills, and show off their amazing projects.
